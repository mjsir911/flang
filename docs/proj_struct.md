#Project Structure

There are a couple standardized branches: Stable, experimental. 
More branches come and go readily.

In the root there are three directories: src, config, and docs.

Inside src goes source files, svgs and code and stuff.

Inside docs goes documentation for the src files.

inside config goes meta information like the version of the current commit
and the tags for src files.


##Repository structures
I'm on the line about having many repositories separating out the large parts of the project, or incorporating them all into one repository somehow.
